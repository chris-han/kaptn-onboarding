---

# 🌌 PHASE 0: ENTRANCE RITUAL

## Screen 1: The Gate
**Visual:** Black screen, single line of white text appearing slowly

```
"Before you step onto the bridge,
your mindset must be calibrated."
```

**[Button: Begin Calibration]**

---

## Screen 2: The Brief
**Visual:** Minimal UI, bridge system aesthetic

```
"This is not a test.
This is a mirror.

You will face five scenarios.
Each scenario reveals how you navigate uncertainty.
There are no wrong answers.
Only patterns."
```

**[Button: Initiate Protocol]**

---

# 🔵 PHASE 1: KNOWLEDGE (观察模式)

## Scenario Title: "Unknown Signal"
**Visual:** Radar screen with an unidentified signal

### Context:
```
"Your venture is stable. Growing 15% quarter over quarter.
Then: an unexpected signal appears in your market space.

A competitor just raised $50M.
Their product overlaps 60% with yours.
Public launch in 90 days."
```

### Your immediate response:

**Option A: SCAN**
"Initiate deep analysis. Who are they? What do they know that I don't?"

**Option B: IGNORE**  
"Hold course. We have our own trajectory."

**Option C: REDIRECT**
"This changes nothing about our mission. Eyes forward."

### What we're measuring:
- **A = 主动探索未知 (Active exploration)**
- **B = 维持现有模型 (Model preservation)**  
- **C = 使命导向过滤 (Mission-filtered observation)**

**[User selects one → System records pattern, no feedback]**

---

# 🟣 PHASE 2: THESIS (解释模式)

## Scenario Title: "Conflicting Data"
**Visual:** Two data streams showing contradictory trends

### Context:
```
"Your sales data shows strong conversion.
Your customer interviews reveal deep friction.

Data says: keep pushing current approach.
Customers say: something fundamental is wrong.

These signals cannot both be right."
```

### How do you resolve this?

**Option A: UPDATE MODEL**
"The model is incomplete. I need to rebuild my understanding."

**Option B: TRUST DATA**  
"Qualitative feedback is noisy. The numbers don't lie."

**Option C: HOLD PARADOX**
"Both can be true. I need more time to understand the structure."

### What we're measuring:
- **A = 快速更新世界观 (Rapid model updating)**
- **B = 数据优先框架 (Data-first framework)**
- **C = 复杂性容忍 (Complexity tolerance)**

**[User selects one → System records pattern]**

---

# 🟠 PHASE 3: PRIORITIZE (决策模式)

## Scenario Title: "Multiple Vectors"
**Visual:** Three pathways diverging from current position

### Context:
```
"Three opportunities, equal potential:

Path A: New market segment (high uncertainty, high upside)
Path B: Deepen current customer base (predictable, steady growth)  
Path C: Strategic partnership (medium risk, accelerated timeline)

Resources allow only ONE path for the next 6 months."
```

### You choose:

**Option A: COMMIT TO ONE**
"Select the critical path. Full focus."

**Option B: PARALLEL EXPLORATION**  
"Split resources. Test all three at smaller scale."

**Option C: DEFER DECISION**
"Not enough information. Run experiments first."

### What we're measuring:
- **A = 果断聚焦 (Decisive focus)**
- **B = 并行探索 (Parallel exploration)**
- **C = 延迟决策 (Deliberate delay)**

**[User selects one → System records pattern]**

---

# 🔴 PHASE 4: ACTION (执行模式)

## Scenario Title: "Mission Ready"
**Visual:** Countdown timer, systems armed

### Context:
```
"Your strategy is clear.
The plan is validated.
The team is aligned.

But: you notice a small inconsistency in the financial model.
It won't change the decision, but it's... there.

Launch is scheduled for tomorrow."
```

### You:

**Option A: LAUNCH NOW**
"Execute. The inconsistency is below significance threshold."

**Option B: PAUSE**  
"Fix the inconsistency first. Even if small."

**Option C: LAUNCH WITH FLAG**
"Proceed, but mark the item for immediate post-launch review."

### What we're measuring:
- **A = 行动偏向 (Action bias)**
- **B = 完整性优先 (Completeness first)**
- **C = 渐进完善 (Progressive refinement)**

**[User selects one → System records pattern]**

---

# 🟢 PHASE 5: NAVIGATION (校准模式)

## Scenario Title: "Course Deviation"
**Visual:** Navigation system showing drift from original trajectory

### Context:
```
"Six months after launch, you review the journey.

The outcome is positive: 40% growth.
But: you achieved it through a completely different approach 
than originally planned.

Your original thesis was about product-market fit.
Reality showed it was actually about distribution channel."
```

### Your response:

**Option A: RECALIBRATE**
"Update the model. This is new knowledge."

**Option B: QUESTION SUCCESS**  
"Success through wrong reasons is concerning. Dig deeper."

**Option C: CLAIM ADAPTATION**
"This proves our navigation ability. The goal matters, not the path."

### What we're measuring:
- **A = 快速校准 (Rapid recalibration)**
- **B = 深层质疑 (Deep questioning)**
- **C = 适应性自豪 (Adaptive confidence)**

**[User selects one → System records pattern]**

---

# 🎭 PHASE 6: THE OATH

## Screen: The Captain's Oath
**Visual:** Starfield background, text appearing line by line

```
"You have completed the calibration.

Now, before you assume command,
you must affirm the Captain's Code."
```

### The Oath (appears slowly, one line at a time):

```
I will not seek certainty.
I will seek clarity.

I will not seek comfort.
I will seek direction.

I will not seek answers.
I will seek better questions.

I will let reality challenge my mind,
my mind challenge my models,
and my models challenge my actions.

This is how a Captain grows.
```

**[Button: Affirm]** (Must click to proceed)

---

# ⚡ PHASE 7: BRIDGE ACTIVATION

## Screen 1: Processing
**Visual:** KAPTN logo with five letters lighting up in sequence

```
K → "Knowledge protocol: Calibrated"
T → "Thesis protocol: Calibrated"  
P → "Prioritize protocol: Calibrated"
A → "Action protocol: Calibrated"
N → "Navigation protocol: Calibrated"
```

---

## Screen 2: Your Decision Style Profile

**Visual:** Bridge console with five indicators (not scores, but orientations)

### Your Bridge Configuration:

**Knowledge Mode: [Active Explorer / Selective Scanner / Mission Filter]**
> When unknown signals appear, you tend to...
> [Brief description matching their choice pattern]

**Thesis Mode: [Rapid Updater / Data Anchor / Complexity Holder]**  
> When models conflict, you tend to...
> [Brief description]

**Priority Mode: [Focused Navigator / Parallel Processor / Deliberate Strategist]**
> When paths diverge, you tend to...
> [Brief description]

**Action Mode: [Momentum Driver / Completeness Seeker / Progressive Builder]**
> When mission is ready, you tend to...
> [Brief description]

**Navigation Mode: [Quick Recalibrator / Deep Questioner / Adaptive Claimer]**
> When drift occurs, you tend to...
> [Brief description]

---

## Screen 3: The Insight (Not Judgment)

**Visual:** Clean text, no decoration

```
"This profile is not an evaluation.
It is a snapshot of how you navigate uncertainty right now.

Your patterns will evolve.
The bridge will adapt with you.

What matters is this:
You are aware of your own navigation system.

That awareness is your first advantage."
```

---

## Screen 4: The Unknown

**Visual:** Starfield, single quote appearing slowly

```
"It is the unknown that defines our existence.

We are constantly searching, not just for answers to our questions,
but for new questions.

— Captain Benjamin Sisko"
```

**[Brief pause, then fade to next screen]**

---

## Screen 5: Welcome

**Visual:** Full KAPTN interface fades in

```
"Welcome aboard, Captain.

Your bridge is calibrated to your command style.
Your protocols are online.
Your trajectory awaits definition.

The unknown is your territory.
KAPTN is your bridge system.

Systems: GREEN.
Status: READY.

[Button: Assume Command]"
```

# 📊 Technical Implementation Notes

## Data Collection (Per User)
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "responses": {
    "K": "SCAN|IGNORE|REDIRECT",
    "T": "UPDATE|TRUST_DATA|HOLD_PARADOX",
    "P": "COMMIT|PARALLEL|DEFER",
    "A": "LAUNCH|PAUSE|FLAG",

```

## Profile Generation Logic
- Map response patterns to decision style descriptors
- No scoring system (avoid gamification)
- Generate unique insight based on combination
- Store as initial OAS (Ontological Alignment Score) baseline

## Integration Points
- Profile feeds into CFR (Counterfactual Reasoning) system
- Influences initial alternative suggestion ranking
- Establishes baseline for "thinks like me" calibration
- Updates over time based on actual usage patterns

---

# 🎪 Why This Works

## 1. **Ceremonial Without Being Performative**
- The oath creates genuine commitment moment
- The visual progression feels significant
- No artificial gamification

## 2. **Informative Without Being Evaluative**  
- Reveals decision patterns without judgment
- User learns about themselves genuinely
- No "good" or "bad" profiles

## 3. **Bridge-Themed Throughout**
- Every scenario uses navigation/ship metaphors
- Consistent with KAPTN brand language  
- Feels like qualification, not test

## 4. **Practical Foundation**
- Directly maps to KAPTN protocols (K-A-T-P-N)
- Generates actionable data for system
- Sets up trust relationship

---

# 🔄 Progressive Disclosure Extension

## Post-Game Feature: "Your Bridge Evolution"

Users can periodically (quarterly?) retake abbreviated version to see how their decision style evolves:

```
"Your Knowledge protocol has shifted from 
Active Explorer → Selective Scanner

This often happens when pattern recognition deepens.
Your bridge has adapted accordingly."
```

This creates:
- Ongoing engagement hook
- Self-awareness growth  
- System improvement feedback loop
- Trust deepening mechanism

---

# 📝 Copywriting Principles

## Voice Guidelines
- **Precise, not flowery** - "Unknown signal detected" not "A mysterious opportunity appears"
- **Respectful, not playful** - User is professional, not playing a game
- **Systemic, not personal** - "The bridge calibrates" not "I'm learning about you"
- **Mission-oriented** - Always forward-looking, never nostalgic

## Language to AVOID
- "Personality type"
- "You are a [label]"  
- "Score" or "rating"
- "Most people choose..."
- "Correct answer"

## Language to USE
- "Protocol"
- "Pattern"
- "Tendency"  
- "Navigation style"
- "Bridge configuration"

---

# 🎁 Bonus: Post-Onboarding Hook

## The First Mission

Immediately after clicking [Assume Command], present:

```
"First order of business, Captain.

Three items require your attention.
Your bridge has pre-sorted them based on your 
calibrated decision protocols.

Ready to engage?"
```

This:
- Provides immediate value
- Demonstrates system already "knows" them
- Smooth transition from onboarding to usage
- No dead-end after ceremony
