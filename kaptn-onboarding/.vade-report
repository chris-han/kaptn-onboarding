# Vercel Web Analytics Integration

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed @vercel/analytics Package
- Used pnpm (the project's package manager) to install `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1
- Updated package.json to include the new dependency
- Updated pnpm-lock.yaml with the new package and its dependencies

### 2. Updated Root Layout (app/layout.tsx)
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- Added the `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after `{children}`
- Preserved all existing code structure, styling, and functionality

## Implementation Details

The Analytics component was placed in the root layout file (`app/layout.tsx`) which ensures that analytics tracking is enabled across all pages of the application. The component was positioned after the `{children}` placeholder within the body tag, following Vercel's best practices for App Router projects.

## Files Modified
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated with new package dependencies

## Verification
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Passed (no type errors)
- Code structure: ✅ Preserved existing patterns
- Dependencies: ✅ Successfully installed

## Notes
- The Analytics component will automatically collect page views and Web Vitals data
- No additional configuration is required - analytics will be active in production deployments
- The build failure encountered was due to missing environment variables (DATABASE_URL, LOGTO_*, RESEND_API_KEY) that are unrelated to the Analytics integration
- These missing environment variables are expected in a local/test environment without proper .env configuration
